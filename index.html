                  <p>
                    Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms,
                    fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing
                    difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause
                    pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure
                    and even death.

                  <p>
                    Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include
                    regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing
                    and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close
                    contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness
                    such as coughing and sneezing.

                              can help stop stigma.

                              People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about
                              friends and relatives who are living in or
                              visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some
                              people are worried about the disease. Fear and
                              anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example,
                              towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people
                              who were in quarantine.

                              Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable
                              group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is
                              associated with a lack of knowledge about how
                              COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears
                              about disease and death, and gossip that spreads
                              rumors and myths.

                              Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or
                              anger towards ordinary people instead of the
                              disease that is causing the problem.

                              Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some
                              cause illness in people, and others, such as
                              canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect
                              animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect
                              animals have emerged to infect people and can
                              spread between people. This is suspected to have
                              occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19.
                              Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
                              Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other
                              examples of coronaviruses that originated from
                              animals and then spread to people. More

                              Province, China. The first infections were linked
                              to a live animal market, but the virus is now
                              spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to
                              note that person-to-person spread can happen on a
                              continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious
                              (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

                              recommends that these patients be isolated either
                              in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick

                              Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread
                              from person-to-person through respiratory
                              droplets. Currently there is no evidence to
                              support transmission of COVID-19 associated with
                              food. Before preparing or eating food it is
                              important to always wash your hands with soap and
                              water for 20 seconds for general food safety.
                              Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing
                              your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the
                              bathroom.

                              It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19
                              by touching a surface or object that has the virus
                              on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or
                              possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be
                              the main way the virus spreads.

                              In general, because of poor survivability of these
                              coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very
                              low risk of spread from food products or packaging
                              that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at
                              ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                              authority. Many countries around the world have
                              seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen
                              outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other
                              countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping
                              their outbreaks. However, the situation is
                              unpredictable so check regularly for the latest

                              precautions:

                                Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with
                                an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap
                                and water. <br /><strong>Why?</strong> Washing
                                your hands with soap and water or using
                                alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be
                                on your hands.

                                Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance
                                between yourself and anyone who is coughing or
                                sneezing. <br /><strong>Why?</strong> When
                                someone coughs or sneezes they spray small
                                liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which
                                may contain virus. If you are too close, you can
                                breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19
                                virus if the person coughing has the disease.

                                <br /><strong>Why?</strong> Hands touch many
                                surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once
                                contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to
                                your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus
                                can enter your body and can make you sick.

                                good respiratory hygiene. This means covering
                                your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or
                                tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of
                                the used tissue immediately. <br /><strong

                                respiratory hygiene you protect the people

                                that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all
                                surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together
                                until they feel dry. Soap and water should be

                              The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever,
                              tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have
                              aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose,
                              sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
                              usually mild and begin gradually. Some people
                              become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and
                              don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover
                              from the disease without needing special
                              treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets
                              COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops
                              difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with
                              underlying medical problems like high blood
                              pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more
                              likely to develop serious illness. People with
                              fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek
                              medical attention.

                              CDC while medical providers are getting tests
                              developed by commercial manufacturers. While

                              still be difficult to find someplace to get

                              This is a new virus and we are still learning
                              about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a
                              lot of illness in children. Most illness,
                              including serious illness, is happening in adults
                              of working age and older adults. If there cases of
                              COVID-19 that impact your child’s school, the
                              school may dismiss students. Keep track of school
                              dismissals in your community. Read or watch local
                              media sources that report school dismissals. If
                              schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative

                              with teachers about classroom assignments and
                              activities they can do from home to keep up with

                              Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread

                              food. Before preparing or eating food it is
                              important to always wash your hands with soap and
                              water for 20 seconds for general food safety.
                              Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing
                              your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the

                              on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or
                              possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be
                              the main way the virus spreads.

                              low risk of spread from food products or packaging

                              From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can
                              be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with
